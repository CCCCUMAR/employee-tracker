# Employee Tracker

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The goal of this project is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
